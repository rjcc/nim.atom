# Nim language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Nim files in Atom. This package will recognize files with a name that ends in `.nim`, or with a first line that starts with `#!` and ends in `nimscript`. (See [this blog post](http://hookrace.net/blog/what-makes-nim-practical/) for an example of using Nim for shell scripting.)

Derived from the [original Nimrod language package by Zahary Karadjov](https://github.com/zah/nimrod.atom).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
